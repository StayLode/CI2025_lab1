After setting up the problem according to the specifications provided by the professor, one can choose among three possible initializations.

Two solution approaches were then implemented: one following the classic hill climbing algorithm, and another incorporating tabu search. 

The latter appears to produce better results, especially as the problem size increases, although it requires slightly more computation time.
